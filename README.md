# Divya-S---Insurance-Claim-Severity-Prediction-Project
 This project builds an insurance claim severity prediction model using **XGBoost** and explains model behavior using **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**.   - The main objective is not just accuracy but **deep interpretability**, enabling risk analysts and stakeholders to understand *why* the model makes specific predictions.
